# Approval Voting for the UK

## What is Approval Voting?
Approval voting is a simple and fair voting system where you can vote for as many candidates as you approve of. You're not limited to just one choice. Each vote counts equally, and the candidate with the most votes wins. This system helps elect candidates with broad support and reduces the chances of "spoiler" candidates splitting the vote.

## Single-Winner Approval Voting
For single-winner elections, such as for a city mayor, approval voting is a straightforward upgrade from the UK's current First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system. Instead of choosing just one candidate, you can approve of any you'd be happy with. This means you can support your favourite candidate without worrying that you're "wasting" your vote if they have little chance of winning. It also means you can support a more popular, compromise candidate as well. This leads to winners who are more broadly supported by the electorate.

## Proportional Representation with Approval Voting
Approval voting can also be used to achieve proportional representation in multi-winner elections, like for the UK Parliament. One method is Proportional Approval Voting (PAV), which extends the principles of approval voting to ensure that different groups of voters are represented in proportion to their numbers. This would be a significant change from the current system and would likely lead to a more diverse and representative Parliament.

## The UK Context
The UK's political landscape is changing. There is growing dissatisfaction with the current voting system, which often leads to governments being formed with a minority of the popular vote. Approval voting offers a practical and achievable reform that could have a profound impact. It could lead to more consensual politics, reduce the number of "safe seats", and give voters a stronger voice.

## Get Involved
There are many ways to get involved in the campaign for approval voting in the UK. You can start by educating yourself and others about the benefits of this voting system.
